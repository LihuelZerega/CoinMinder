            Origins of the Stock Market:
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first signs of an organized securities market date back to
            ancient Rome, where loan contracts and public debts were negotiated
            on street boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the modern stock market originated in the 17th century
            Netherlands, with the creation of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in
            1602. This was the first formal stock exchange where shares of
            commercial and colonial companies were traded.

            Main Historical Events:
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was a crucial turning
            point in the history of the stock market, as it marked the emergence
            of new companies and industrial sectors, leading to a rise in stock
            trading.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1929 Wall Street crash, known as &quot;Black Thursday,&quot; was one of
            the most devastating events in stock market history, marking the
            beginning of the Great Depression and leading to significant
            regulatory reform in the financial markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The emergence of information technology and globalization in the
            21st century has radically transformed financial markets,
            facilitating electronic trading, access to information in real time
            and the emergence of new financial instruments such as derivatives
            and investment funds.
