            Market Risks:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Stocks are subject to market volatility, meaning prices can
            fluctuate significantly in a short period of time due to factors
            such as economic events, politics, or corporate news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes in interest rates, inflation, economic growth and other
            macroeconomic factors can affect the performance of the stock market
            as a whole.

            Company Specific Risks:
          </h2>
          <p>

            Currency and Political Risks:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Investments in foreign stocks are subject to currency risks, as
            fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the value of investments
            in local currency.

            Liquidity Risks:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some stocks may have limited liquidity in the market, making it
            difficult to quickly buy or sell shares without significantly
            affecting their price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investors should consider the liquidity of stocks before making
            investments, especially in less developed markets or smaller
            capitalization companies.

            To manage these risks and minimize losses, investors can follow some
            key tips:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Diversify the investment portfolio to reduce exposure to risks
            specific to a single stock or sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conduct extensive research before investing, including fundamental
            and technical analysis of the selected stocks.

          <p>

            short-term market volatility.
          </p>

            Use risk management tools, such as stop-loss orders, to limit losses
            in the event of unfavorable market movements.
