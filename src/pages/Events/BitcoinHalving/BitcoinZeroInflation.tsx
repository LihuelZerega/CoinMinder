          Now, it is impossible to know what the price of Bitcoin will be in the
          future, but let&apos;s agree that it is better to buy Bitcoin today than
          wait for inflation to reach 0%.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, the fact that Bitcoin inflation reaches 0% makes Bitcoin
          the scarcest asset on the planet. There is nothing else in the world
          that has such absolutely limited supply.
