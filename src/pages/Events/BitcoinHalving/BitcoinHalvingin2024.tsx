          The 2020 Bitcoin halving will take place in May and will see the block
          reward drop from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. Bitcoin&apos;s
          current annual inflation is 3.68%, but after the 2024 halving
          inflation will be halved to approximately 1.80%.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that Bitcoin inflation will be lower than the official 2%
          inflation target set by central banks. The gold inflation rate is at
          1.6%, and gold has a market capitalization of approximately $9
          trillion.
