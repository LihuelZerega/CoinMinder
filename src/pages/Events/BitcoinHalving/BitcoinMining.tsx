      <h1>Bitcoin Mining and the Reward of Mining</h1>
      <p>
        Bitcoin mining refers to the process of digitally adding transaction
        records to the blockchain.
        <br />
        By mining, you can earn cryptocurrency without having to put money into
        it. So, when someone uses their computing power to validate
        transactions, they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.
        <br />
        This is done because the Bitcoin network is decentralized, so there is
        no central bank or authority validating transactions.
        <br />
        The Bitcoin network is self-sustaining by using newly minted coins as an
        incentive for people to offer their computing power.
        <br />
        Every time a miner solves a mathematical problem in a block of the
        Bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with Bitcoin. This is called a
        “block reward.” A new block is added to the blockchain approximately
        every 10 minutes.
