      <h1>What is Bitcoin Halving?</h1>
      <p>
        The Bitcoin halving occurs once every four years. It is when the future
        supply of Bitcoin is halved.
        <br />
        With this feature, the total supply of new Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency
        market will continue to decrease. As the years go by, this will protect
        Bitcoin from inflation while ensuring that the value and price of
        Bitcoin continue to rise.
        <br />
        To better understand the Bitcoin halving, how new Bitcoins are created
        and added to the cryptocurrency market, let's explain the term "Bitcoin
        Mining" and how it works.
